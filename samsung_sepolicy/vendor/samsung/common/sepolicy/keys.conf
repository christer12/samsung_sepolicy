# Maps an arbitrary tag [TAGNAME] with the string contents found in
# TARGET_BUILD_VARAINT. Common convention is to start TAGNAME with an @ and
# name it after the base file name of the pem file.
#
# Each tag (section) then allows one to specify any string found in
# TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT. Typcially this is user, eng, and userdebug. Another
# option is to use ALL which will match ANY TARGET_BUILD_VARAINT string.
